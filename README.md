# CML---Enterprice-lab
This is a CML lab for enterprise network design and configuration. 
The lab is a work in progress and is designed to help users understand the basics of enterprise network design and configuration using Cisco Modeling Labs (CML). The lab will include various network devices such as routers, switches, and firewalls, which are configured to simulate a real-world enterprise network environment.

Etch device will have its own notes file, which will include information about the device's role in the network, its configuration, and any relevant details that may be useful for understanding the lab.

I will try to write notes in a blogging style, which will be in the "docs" folder. My goal is to make it easier for users to follow along and understand the concepts being presented, with examples and explanations to help users grasp the concepts being discussed.

I will be updating this lab regularly, so please check back for new devices and configurations. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to me.
